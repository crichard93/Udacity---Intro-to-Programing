# Intro to Udacity Projects  
This is a collection of projects I worked on during my time spent completing  
Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Each project has an individual README in  
their directory that provides instruction on how to run the project. Below is a  
brief overview of each project. 

## Python Version 2
Please note that all projects involving Python utilized Python 2.7.14 and will not run  
with Python 3.x. I was not opposed to Python 3, but the courses were taught in Python 2  
so the projects are in Python 2 as a result.  

## Logs Analysis Project  
In this project, I used the PostgresQL DB API and Python to generate a report from a  
database on several key details, such as, the most popular authors and days where 1% or  
more of the views resulted in an error.  

## Stylish Webpage  
I utitlized HTML5 and CSS to create a project summarizing and styling my notes  using  
concepts learned from the course.  

## Movie Website  
Using OOP concepts in Python, I put together a movie website with HTML and CSS with  
some of my favorite movies.  

## Quiz  
Using Python, I create a fill-in-the-blank style quiz that a user can take that  has  
different levels of difficulty.
