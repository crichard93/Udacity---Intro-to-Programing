# Stylish Webpage  
I created this project to practice using what I learned from Udacity's Intro to Programming  
lessons on HTML and CSS. It consists of my notes from the courses and CSS styling.  

## Running the page  
Open the webpage, **stylish_web_page.html**, with the browser of your choosing after  
downloading all the contents of this directory.
