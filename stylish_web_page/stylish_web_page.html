				<p> 
					The Web is a collection of HTML documents connected through several components. The major components are: Browsers, Servers, Internet, and HTML documents.
					Browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, make requests to servers through the Internet using HTTP protocol in order to view HTML documents. 
					Servers are computers specialized to host HTML files. Servers will send the HTML document to the Brower, which is then interpretted by the browser to provide a web page for the user.

				<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> HTML </h4>
				<p> 
					HTML stands for <em> Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It's components are text content, markup (or formatting), and references to other documents, e.g. images and videos 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Sub_Lesson_Body">
				<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> HTML Tags and Elements</h4>
				<p> 
					HTML elements are used to engineer HTML documents. Each element begins with an opening tag  and most end with a closing tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/-0S9lBFHeo0">
					This video</a> explains the structure of elements very thoroughly! 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Sub_Lesson_Body">
				<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> Inline and Block Elements </h4>
				<p>
					Block elements draw an invisible container around their text. Anything outside of the block will go to the next line or previous lines.  
					Inline elements can be thought of as characters, in that they will output on the same line as the last text/inline element provided there is room in the line.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some examples of <em> block </em> elements include &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, and &lt;form&gt;. 
				<br>
					Some examples of <em> inline </em> elements are formatting elements, such as &lt;b&gt; and &lt;em&gt;. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Sub_Lesson_Body">
				<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> HTML Document Structure </h4>
				<p> 
					Each HTML document has a common structure. <a href = "https://youtu.be/VL7Wm0UzY6s"> This video </a> provides a thorough breakdown of the structure of HTML documents. 
					The components of the HTML structure are:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li> Doctype - Declares version of HTML of document. html as the doctype is HTML5</li>
						<li> HTML - element that encloses everything except doctype</li>
						<li> Head - Metedata that is not visible in the window, but is relevant to the page goes here</li>
						<li> Title - This is the text that is displayed as the title of the window for this page. </li>
						<li> Body - This is where the text displayed to the user is placed. </li>
					</ol>

				<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> Languages Used to Build a Webpage </h4>
				<p>
					Three languages used to design web pages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
					With a web page open in your browser, you can right click anywhere on the web page and select <b> Inspect Element</b> 
					to bring up the developer tools. This allows you to view and edit the brower's interpretation of the page, which includes
					its interpretation of HTML and CSS code used to create the web page. 
					Each of these languages serve a unique purpose within Front-End Web Development, succinctly described below:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li> HTML - Provides the page with structure and text.</li>
						<li> CSS - Used to style HTML texts and objects, such as font size and color to name a few properties.</li>
						<li> JavaScript - Allows the user to interact with the page.</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="Horizontal_Text">

							Elements, enclosed by tags in HTML, become rectangular objects when 
							the page is interpreted by a web browser. These objects form the Document Object Model, or <b>DOM</b>, which is a hierachical tree of the objects on the page. The image to the right, via https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif, demonstrates the hierarchy of a web page.
						</p>
						<p>
							All objects, even ones that are explicitly circles, are technically rectangular objects on the web page. 
							<a href = http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/shapes.html > 
							This page</a> provides an example to view and experiment with the CSS styling behind some circular-looking objects
							that are actually rectangular objects on the page. Just right click and press <b> Inspect Element </b>. 
							Additionally, <b> boxifying </b> is the term used to describe visually dividing a web page into its most basic rectangular objects.

		<div class="Sub_Lesson_Body">
			<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> CSS Basics</h4>
			<p>
				CSS is the web development language used to stylize web pages. It does this by applying a defined style to elements identified by either a class or tag.  
				CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The term "cascading" arises from the fact that style rules are applied to child elements, a feature that can save developers time. 
				Another great feature is that the child elements styling can be overwritten, if needed, as the most specific style is applied in CSS. 
				When a browswer displays a page to the user, there is an order (think order of operations in algebra), that style is applied. 
				First, the default stayle of the browser's style is applied, then the style specified by a separate .css file overwrites any browser style. 
				Following that, a stylesheet inside of the HTML file is applied after both of the previous options. Finally, any inline style elements are applied last. 
				Ideally, we should only use a separate .css file, but small projects benefit from using a stylesheet internal to the HTML file. 
				Last, but not least, any inline styles are displayed last, however, inline style elements are very cluttering, so they should be avoided. 
			</p>

		<div class="Sub_Lesson_Body">
			<h4 class="Lesson_Subheader"> Applying CSS Style</h4>
			<p>
				In order to apply CSS styling, you will have to write a selector to identify elements of the page that the style will apply to on the page. 
				The elements can be defined by either their class or their tag. A class is declared in the HTML file within the opening and classing tags as an attribute. 
				Below is an example of assigning an element a class and then a style within the HTML file:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="Centered_Image" src="Example_of_declaring_classes_and_applying_style.jpg" alt="Example image of declaring class and applying style">
			</p>
			<p>	
				In the example above, provided by Udacity's Intro to Programming materials via https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/c166b0b6-d5c7-4cc9-9595-2b7a1c7b75e1/modules/01b5b80f-8256-4126-bf54-b11f809acd88/lessons/d48f9f5d-8b12-4a12-b59c-2c5c909ec99c/concepts/3b843526-d272-434c-a13b-456cd0ecb3b2, the stylesheet is included in the HTML file. Within the example, 3 different &lt;div&gt;s classes are defined; stop, slow, and go. 
				Each one is an element on the page. The &lt;div&gt;s tag elements are all assigned the same size height and width, while each element is then separately assigned a different background color using their classes. 
				This is a great example of utilizing CSS style to create a stoplight on a webpage within the HTML.

					<div class="Horizontal_Text">
						<p>
							More often, you will use a separate .css file to apply style to a page. 
							In order to link the HTML file to the CSS file, you will need to utilize the
							head section of the HTML. 
							In the HTML text, you use the &lt;link&gt; tag within the &lt;head&gt; element to create the link to the CSS file. 
						</p> An example of doing that is to the right:
					</div>
					<div class="Horizontal_Image">
						<p>
							<img class="Example Image" src="Example_of_linking_a_css_file.jpg" alt="Example of Linking a css file here">
